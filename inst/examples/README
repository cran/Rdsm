running the examples:

   Load the Rdsm library.  

   Then run as follows (expected results are given at the end of each
   file), say with 2 clients (some can be run with more):

      open 3 terminal windows, and run R in each
      in the first window, do
         srvr()  # starts server (do BEFORE init() below)
      in each of the other 2 windows, do
         source("yourfilename.R")
         init()  # establishes connection with server
         yourtestfunction()  # run the test function, typically () here

quick start:

   As your first introduction to Rdsm, MatMult.R is suggested.  It has
   very extensive comments, designed to educate the Rdsm novice; read
   those first.
