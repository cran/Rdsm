Rdsm shared variables can be readable/writable from other concurrently
running R processes, following this example:

# say have shared variable x in an Rdsm run, invovked from a directory
# ~/u

# at the manager, do

desc <- bigmemory::describe(x)
save(desc,file="x")  


# at the other R process, do

load("~/u/x")
tmp <- bigmemory::attach.big.matrix(desc)
assign("x",tmp)

# x is now accessible, so that e.g. can do

x[2,5] <- 8

# and x[2,5] will change to 8 in the Rdsm run
